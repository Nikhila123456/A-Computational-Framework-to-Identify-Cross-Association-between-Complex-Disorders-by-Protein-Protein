# A-Topological-Approach-for-dealing-with-Cross-Disease-Association-by-Protein-Protein-Interaction-Net
The aim of this work is to identify distinctive key genes and biological pathways shared among diseases.	
We presented a systematic strategy to characterize multimorbidity of diseases at network level. Developed framework deals with a multi stage analysis of comorbid diseases. For simulation, we have taken diabetes, obesity and blood pressure as random diseases due to its complex and comorbid nature. To study diseasesâ€™ association, genes related to these disease are collected one by one and generated PPIN with respect to each of the diseases. After topological analysis of PPIN in terms of degree centrality, a gene prioritization mechanism is performed to identify key genes in each case studies separately. Using these key genes, pathway analysis is performed to find key pathways related to each of the diseases. Most of the resultant pathways are closely related to multiple disorders.
